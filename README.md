Memento Mori
============

A reminder of your mortality, in the shell.

Memento Mori is a little script meant to be sourced in your shell profile (.bash_profile, .zshrc, etc.) which reminds you how old you are and, how long until you're even older.

It's helpful if you're a weirdo like me who's so bad with dates you often forget this information. It's also intended to be motivational for procastinators (again, myself). It's also a bit morbid. (Yes again.)

It will only bug you once a day unless something is broken.
